            <p>The turtle is giving the children a feeling for the properties of an angle. They experience an abstract concept.</p>

            <p>We all accept that we learn French easily in France. So why not maths in Mathsland?</p>

            <p>Today, the girls are programming the turtle to draw a dice. They got the outline. Now, they’re experimenting with shapes.</p>

        <div data-begin="254.55">
            <p>The great thing is it does provide mathematical environment for the children. And when the children are working around the turtle, if you listen to the things they are talking about: it’s all mathematical. And I think verbalization of mathematics is very  important and I think that half of that problem with mathematics teaching is because children don’t communicate mathematically, talk about mathematics and that they should experience mathematical problems.</p>
